# Code and Data for "A First Look at Certification Authority Authorization"

Code and Data from our publication "A First Look at Certification Authority Authorization" are primarily hosted at The University Library of the Technical University of Munich, guaranteeing integrity and long-term availability. 

As the data there, once published, can not be changed, we maintain this repository for 2 reasons:
  * Ease of access -- browsing source code is easier on github
  * Updates -- reproduction of our work might yield updates to code, be it in the form of new scripts, changes to existing scripts, and updated documentation.
